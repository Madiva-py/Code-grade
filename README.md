# Java Script Basics: Variables, Conditions, and Functions

---

## Description
This project is used to show the basicas of Java Script. I did this by completing a series of tasks that was designed to show programming logic and proper way of arranging the different elements(syntax)

### Overview 
The project therefore shows basic Java script concepts in action, including:

- Variable and Data types
- Type Conversion
- Conditional Statements and Control flow
- Functions and Scope

 ---

## Technology used

- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**

## How To Setup

To see and use the Java script code I did you should,

- clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madiva-py/Code-grade.git
```

- open cloned repo in `visual Studio Code`

```bash
code assignment.js
```

- **Run the project**


```bash
node assignment.js
```

# Here is each task's summary and what to expect
---
### Task 1: Variable Manipulation
- I declared variableds with defferent data types.
- I then logged all variables to the console using 
```Js
console.log()
```
- converted a string into an array using
```Js
split('')
```
- I then converted a number into a string using 
```Js
tostring()
```
## Console output step 1

### Task 2: Conditional Statements and Control Flow
- I created a function called CheckAge using 
```Js
function
```
- I then used switch statement to create an if else scenario using.
```Js
switch (true) 
```
- I then used a sample age of 20 to check the integrity of the code using the code.
```Js
console.log(CheckAge(20))
```

### Task 3:  Functions and Scope
- I created a function called calculateArea
- I then used switch to create an if else scenario again
----
## Showcasing Scope
- I declared the variable inside the function

```Js
let area;

```
- I then called the function twice within the scope and outside the scope using console.log

*WITHIN SCOPE*

- After i called the same function outside the scope proving that its not accesible.

*OUTSIDE SCOPE*
